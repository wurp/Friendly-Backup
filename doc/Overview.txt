How data is stored:

1) The list of files to be backed up is put together as a text file, along with the date of the backup.  This is called the backup manifest.
2) Each of the files in the backup manifest are backed up, using the computer name + file name as a label.
3) The backup manifest itself is backed up, using the backup stream as a label.
  * (The backup stream is just a way of naming your backups so you can have multiple different serieses of backups.)


How a file is backed up:
1) The file to be backed up is broken into 60 erasure blocks, each 1/40th the size of the whole file.
  * Any 40 of these blocks can be used to recover the original file.
2) Each erasure block is stored on a "friend node".
  * The identifier for the data is the SHA1 hash of the contents of the block.
  * The friend is determined by going through your friend list round-robin for each erasure block.
3) An erasure manifest is created, listing the SHA1 hashes of all the erasure blocks.
4) The erasure manifest is stored on all friend nodes.
  * The identifier for the data is the SHA1 hash of the contents of the manifest.
4) A label is created which contains the identifier of the erasure manifest, the owner's identity, the label name itself, and a signature of all the data.
  *  The identifier of the label is the hash of the owner + label name.
